# disk-failure-prediction
project: It includes data selection, dataset display, feature analysis, feature construction, feature transformation, traditional machine learning, and visualization
sample_index: Includes sliding window extraction and randomly selects healthy samples
clean_smart_logs: Data cleaning
Deep-learning: Deep Learning models, hybrid models and visualization
10 and 30 represent the proportions extracted from the overall disk failure sample for subsequent sliding window extraction and dataset construction
